Good Venky 👍
I will explain this in **very simple English**, step-by-step flow in paragraphs.

---

This API is:

```
GET /user/get?id=123
```

It is used to **get details of a single user** using user ID.

---

Now let’s understand the controller first.

The controller method:

```
@GetMapping("/user/get")
```

It takes `id` as a request parameter.

Example:

```
/user/get?id=5
```

Then it calls:

```
adminService.userGet(id)
```

And returns the result with HTTP 200 (OK).

That’s all the controller does.

---

Now let’s understand the service method.

Inside `userGet(Long id)`:

First, it creates an empty `UsersDTO` object.

Then it tries to fetch the user from database:

```
usersRepository.findByIdAndActive(id, true)
```

This means:
👉 It will only fetch the user if:

* ID matches
* User is active = true

If user is inactive or does not exist,
it will return null.

---

Now the condition:

If `usersModel` is not null,
that means the user exists.

So it converts the database model into DTO using:

```
constructUsersResponse(usersModel)
```

This method basically:
👉 Converts UsersModel → UsersDTO
👉 Removes unnecessary fields
👉 Prepares clean response for frontend

---

If `usersModel` is null,
that means:

* User does not exist
  OR
* User is inactive

So it throws:

```
CMARFException(ErrorEnum.INVALID_USER)
```

This prevents returning invalid or deleted users.

---

After successful conversion:

It creates a `ResponseDTO`.

It sets:

```
responseStatus = "Success"
```

Then attaches it to `usersDTO`.

Finally, it returns `usersDTO`.

---

Now full flow in simple steps:

1. Receive user ID
2. Fetch user from database (only active users)
3. If not found → throw INVALID_USER
4. If found → convert to DTO
5. Set response status as Success
6. Return user details

---

In simple words:

👉 This method fetches one user
👉 It checks if the user is active
👉 If not found, it throws error
👉 If found, it returns user details
👉 It is a safe and clean read operation

---

Very simple compared to your create and list methods 😄

If you want, I can next explain:

* How constructUsersResponse usually works internally
* Or how to improve this API (like adding role-based security)
* Or how to write unit test for this method

Tell me what you want next 👍
