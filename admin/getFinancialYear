1. This function returns financial year values.
2. It takes a boolean input called `currentYear`.
3. It gets the current year using `Year.now()`.
4. If `currentYear = true`, it returns only the current financial year.
5. Current financial year format is: currentYear - nextYear (e.g., 2026-2027).
6. If `currentYear = false`, it returns two years.
7. First is the current financial year.
8. Second is the previous financial year (e.g., 2025-2026).
