Super Venky 👍
I’ll explain this in **very simple flow**, only in **10 lines**.

### ✅ What This Function Is Doing (Simple 10-Line Explanation)

1. This API is used to **get police station list**.
2. It receives `districtId` or `rdoId` from request body.
3. If `districtId` is given → it fetches all active police stations from that district.
4. Else if `rdoId` is given → it fetches police stations mapped to that RDO.
5. To do that, it first gets all active police station users.
6. Then it gets mapping records from `police_rdo` table using `rdoId`.
7. It filters only those users whose IDs exist in mapping table.
8. If neither district nor rdo is given → it fetches all active police stations.
9. Then it converts `UsersModel` into `PoliceStationDTO` (id + name only).
10. Finally, it sets the list in DTO and returns response with status “Success”.

### 🔥 In One Line (Big Picture)

👉 This function returns a filtered list of active police stations based on district or RDO.

If you want, I can also explain:

* 🔹 Why filtering is done manually for RDO case
* 🔹 How this can be optimized using JOIN query
* 🔹 Flow diagram explanation
* 🔹 How to improve this code like a senior developer
