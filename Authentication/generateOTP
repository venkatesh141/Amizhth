This API is used to generate an OTP when a user tries to log in. When the user calls the `/generateotp` endpoint, 
they send either a PS Code or a mobile number. The controller first collects the user’s IP address and adds it to the request.
Then it passes the request to the service layer, where the actual validation and OTP logic happens.

Inside the service, the system first checks whether the user has provided a PS Code or a mobile number.
If a PS Code is given, it attempts to decrypt it to ensure the data is secure and not tampered with. 
If decryption fails, it treats it as a security breach. If decryption succeeds, the system checks the database to see whether an active user exists
with that PS Code. If a mobile number is provided instead, the same process happens: it is decrypted for security validation and then checked in 
the database to confirm that an active user exists.

If no valid user is found, the system throws an appropriate error such as invalid credentials or 
invalid phone number. If a valid and active user is found, the system then calls the OTP utility method to send an OTP to the user’s registered mobile number.
Finally, based on whether the OTP was successfully sent or not, the controller returns either a success response (“OTP Sent”) or a failure response (“OTP Not Sent”) to the client.
